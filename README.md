# GaussRF

*A Python module for simulation of random fields.*

## Description

GaussRF is a module that contains numerically simulates Gaussian random fields (RFs) via the Karhunen-Loeve approximation and Poisson point process simulations. So far there is support for Gaussian RFs in 1D and 2D rectangles, and there is support for homogeneous Poisson processes in 2D rectangular domains, on a 2D disk and on the surface of a sphere. The original motivation to write this module was the author's interest in random field models in oceanography and geoscience.

## installation
